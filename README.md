# Play Calling Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to develop an understanding of the play calling habits of the Cincinatti Bengals for the years 2019-2023, specifically as they relate to 1st, 2nd, and 3rd down. The R programming language was used and the data comes from the nflFastR package, which scrapes its data straight from NFL.com.
